## Document Format

ECAR documents typically feature:
- Structured regulatory sections
- Hierarchical numbering systems
- Technical specifications and standards
- Compliance requirements and procedures
- Appendices with detailed technical data

## Testing Purpose

This folder should contain ECAR PDF documents for testing the AeroSync document processing capabilities, including:
- Advanced PDF text extraction
- Document type identification and classification
- Hierarchical section parsing
- Content quality evaluation
- Regulatory content analysis

## How to Add ECAR Documents

1. Place ECAR PDF files in this folder
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `ECAR-Part-145-Maintenance-Organizations.pdf`)
3. Include various document types and complexity levels
4. Ensure documents are official regulatory publications

## Supported Features

The AeroSync backend provides ECAR document support with:
- Pattern-based document classification
